## Current Session

### 2026-08-15 19:44 PST

Summary of what was done:

- Inspected the repository baseline, Unity version, package manifest, Git status, and existing project documentation.
- Created the initial active `.agents/` context system and `.archive/` category/index structure.
- Recorded only non-sensitive repository facts and the context-system operating rules.
- Verified that all 14 required Markdown files exist, their relative links resolve, active-file sizes are within limits, no trailing whitespace is present, and no credential-like values were written.

Files touched:

- `.agents/README.md`
- `.agents/INDEX.md`
- `.agents/context.md`
- `.agents/memory.md`
- `.agents/learnings.md`
- `.agents/logs.md`
- `.agents/agents/default-agent.md`
- `.archive/README.md`
- `.archive/INDEX.md`
- `.archive/logs/INDEX.md`
- `.archive/memory/INDEX.md`
- `.archive/learnings/INDEX.md`
- `.archive/context/INDEX.md`
- `.archive/agents/INDEX.md`

Decisions made:

- The initial setup creates no dated archive snapshot because there was no earlier active material to preserve.
- Future archive indexes will be maintained in recent-to-oldest order and archive filenames will use the requested DD-MM-YY convention.

Issues found:

- No prior `.agents/` or `.archive/` structure existed.
- `IDEA.md` was already untracked before this setup and was not modified.

Next steps:

- Decide the first package scope and package registry conventions.
- Commit the agent-context system if it should be shared with other repository users.
